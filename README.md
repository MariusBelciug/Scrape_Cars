# Car Dealer Data Scraper

A simple, robust Python web scraper that extracts detailed information about car dealers from a specified website (https://www.cars.com) using BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas, and exports the data to an Excel file for further analysis. The code navigates through the website's structure, retrieves relevant details about the cars and dealers, and organizes this data into a structured format using a Pandas DataFrame.
